# Chess 0.1.1 (Work in progress)

This project is simply an online chess board. Everyone should be able to play without restriction. Rooms should be able to be created and entered. Perfect for example to show friends different tactics etc. or just to enjoy a simple design.

### Known issues
- (fixed) When the size of the window is changed, the positions of the figures change. Are therefore no longer on their squares
- (fixed) The position of the figures when dragging must be calculated correctly again

### Work in progress
- Database connection
- Creation of Rooms
